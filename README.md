## **Project Overview**

**XRPMG (XAJ-RAG-MAML-PGRKU coupled model)** is a general and highly integrated learning framework focused on hydrological time series analysis and prediction in complex watersheds.

The framework integrates data-driven learning with physical constraints via the **PGRKU model**, uses a **meta-learning (MAML) strategy** to enhance generalization across different watersheds, and incorporates a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mechanism** to dynamically integrate relevant historical information, thereby maintaining high prediction accuracy during extreme events (such as floods).

## **Key Features**

  - **Hybrid Learning Architecture**: Combines data-driven deep learning with physical meta-learning to handle complex, non-linear hydrological processes.
  - **Meta-Learning Strategy**: Employs the MAML algorithm, enabling the model to quickly adapt to unseen watershed data, significantly improving its generalization capability.
  - **Physical Constraint Integration**: Embeds physical laws and hydrological process knowledge into the model to ensure prediction results align with hydraulic principles.
  - **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Dynamically retrieves information from historical data/knowledge bases to provide key context for the model.
  - **Feature Explanation Function**: Provides a SHAP-based explanation tool to analyze the importance of features behind the model's predictions.

## **Configuration Guide**

### **Configuration File Structure**

Configuration files are located in the `Config/` directory and use the **YAML** format.
`config_schema.json` is used to validate the configuration file format.

The main sections include:

  - **data**: Dataset configuration block

      - `datasets`: List of datasets (`name`, `processors`, `path`, `target_column`)
      - `processors`: Data preprocessing steps and parameters
      - `window`: Sliding window size
      - `test_size`: Test set ratio

  - **models**: Model configuration

      - Each model is defined by `name`.
      - Includes `enabled` and `type` fields.
      - Optional `params`: Model hyperparameters.
      - Optional `trainer`: Training configuration (e.g., cross-validation `cv`, evaluation metrics `scoring`).

  - **analyzers**: Post-experiment analysis tools configuration.

  - **output**: Experiment results output paths (`analysis_result_path`, `data_result_path`).

## **Usage Instructions**

1.  **Prepare Data**
    Save the time series data as a **CSV file**, ensuring it contains all relevant feature columns and the target column.

2.  **Configure the Experiment**
    Modify the `Config/test.yaml` file, or use the provided GUI tool:

    ```bash
    python config_gui.py
    ```

3.  **Run the Experiment**
    Execute the main script:

    ```bash
    python -m src.run
    ```

## **Technical Innovations**

  - **Coupling of Physical Knowledge and Deep Learning**
    Incorporates physical constraints into the PGRKU model, making prediction results more interpretable and physically sound.

  - **Adaptive Generalization Capability**
    Utilizes the MAML meta-learning method, allowing the model to quickly adapt to new watersheds and reducing its reliance on large amounts of historical data.

  - **Context-Aware Prediction**
    Leverages the RAG module to dynamically retrieve relevant historical information, effectively addressing extreme events like floods.

## **Performance Metrics**

The framework supports multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, including:

  - **Prediction Accuracy**: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ²
  - **Hydrological Metrics**: NSE, KGE
  - **Physical Constraint Satisfaction**: Constraint violation penalty score
